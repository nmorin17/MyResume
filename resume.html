            <strong>BIO</strong>
            <p>Nate's career has been in accounting but in each place he's worked he's drifted toward 
            utilizing technology to improve processes.  For example, at Ripley Doorn he played a lead role in transitioning
            the firm to a paperless process utilizing SurePrep software.  As time went by, Nate realized he was interested more in the technology aspects
            of his responsibilities and after careful consideration made the determination to change careers to become a software developer. </p>
